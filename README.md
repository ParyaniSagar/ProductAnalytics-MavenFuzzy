## MavenFuzzyFactory - Product Analytics

### In this project, my objective is to leverage SQL queries to efficiently gather data and derive valuable insights in response to the inquiries posed by the stakeholders. The following are the key questions that will guide our analysis.

## Questions
1. What are the overall sessions and order volume, Trended by quarter for the life of the business?
2. Have any efficiency improvements taken place, Quarterly figures since launch, session-to-order conversion rate, revenue per order, revenue per session.
3. Quarterly view of orders from different paid/non-paid campaigns, organic search, direct traffic.
4. Overall session-to-order conversion trends for the same channels, by quarter. (Can highlight significant periods characterized by major optimizations).
5. Monthly trends for revenue and margin by product, along with total sales and revenue. Note anything about seasonality.
6. Pull Monthly sessions form products, show % sessions clicking through another page and find overall click-through rate.
